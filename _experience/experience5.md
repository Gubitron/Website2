### Solution Description

The goal of the project was to take an existing automated test solution that mainly relied on batch scripts and a lot of manual labor from the test engineers and turn it into an automated one. 
For that purpose, a system was designed that could test 4 products at the same time by simply entering each product details and pressing a single button. The interface was purposefully desgined to be as simple as possible to reduce
operator mistakes and to be very easy to learn how to use.

<br>A grand total of 25 custom PCBs were designed to interface the Units Under Test (UUT) with a selection of instruments, provide signal conditioning and signal switching. The instruments included:
1. Serial communication module (utilizing UART);
1. Signal switching hardware;
1. Digital IO module;
1. Source Measurement Unit (SMU);
1. Counter card;
1. Numerous power supplies;
1. JTAG module;

<br>Developing the test software was a challenge, due to part of the source code missing for the original test system and the test specification not always matching how the products were behaving.
However, due to proactively communicating with the customers, the missing pieces were eventually reverse engineering and the new test system was completed.

<br>Not only did the final solution reduce the amount of manual labour required to test the UUTs, but it also reduce the time needed to test the units by about 70% percent.
