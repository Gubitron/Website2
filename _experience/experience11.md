<br>This was a project meant to demonstrate the capabilities of the myRIO. Utilizing only a myRIO, a webcam and a pan/tilt mechanism - the system was able to accurately track a user selected colour by keeping the camera image centered on the the colour. The colour tracking was done using an inbuilt machine learning function provided in LabVIEW. In addition, the myRIO transmitted the camera image wirelessly to a user interface and allowed the user to control the camera pan and tilt manually.
