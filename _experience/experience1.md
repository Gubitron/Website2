### Solution Description

For this project a jet fighter component needed to be tested functionaly and under harsh environmental conditions. Therefore, a test system was developed that could control over 30 instruments and was able to control an environmental chamber (thermal and vibration). The instrumentation included:
1. Multiple switching matrices;
1. Multiple DMMs;
1. Multiple Scopes;
1. Various PSUs;
1. Various programmable electrical loads;
1. Custom PCBs
1. Multiple communication cards

To better utilise the environmental chamber - it was decided that three units would be tested at once. Because of that - most instruments had duplicates in the system, to ensure that each UUT can use their respective instruments in parallel, therefore shortening the overall test time. Although, some instruments had to be used as shared resources, due to cost savings.

In the end, the system would carry out over 20 000 tests per UUT.
