### Solution Description

The purpose of the project was to use two [hexapod platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_platform) to simulate the motion between two train carriages, 
so that a flexible gangway can be installed between them and tested for it's durability over it's estimated lifecycle.

<br>The customers had acquired a lot of data for the train tracks their products were going to be used on and already had an older solution. 
However their solution was limited to only 3 Degrees of Freedom (DOF), while they needed the full 6 DOF to be able to simulate all the use cases. 

<br>A solution was designed, while colaborating with two other companies, that would provide the necessary 6 DOF and would automate the whole test process. It involved:
1. 2x Hexapod platforms;
1. A real-time controller to synchronise the platforms;
1. Some digital IO for the safety features of the system;
1. An industrial PC to provide a user interface and to log the data;

<br>The test process involved data taken from the worst case train track portions and repeating that worst case scenario as many times as it would be repeated during 20 years of real operation. 
During the test, precise position and force measurements were logged to evaluate the performance of the gangway. The gagnway itself would be inspected for wear and tear at predefined points in the test process.

<br>Overall, this system allowed the customer to not only increase the range of test scenarios, but also to acquire much more useful test data and to reduce the overall test time, as the newer hardware allowed for faster operation.
