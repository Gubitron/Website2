### Solution Description

Two different systems were designed for the project. One that could intercheangibly test either [Signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_signalling) or [Points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_machine) modules. And one that could test Data Link modules (sort of a repeater for the previous two). The testing would be done either for new modules or it would be used for servicing and repairing old ones.

<br>The Signals and Points test system would allow the user to install the unit under test (UUT) in a pull-out drawer, connect the appropriate harness, push the drawer in, enter test information and press start. The system would then automatically make electrical connections to the appropriate instrumentation, such as, oscilloscope, power supplies, digital multimeter, flash tester and other IO. Finally, since the test procedure involved using high voltage and current - a light curtain was installed, that would shut down the power to the UUT, if an operator decided to touch the product for whatever reason.

<br>The data link module test system would have similar functionality as the Signals and Points test system, however it had less instrumentation, was simpler and, in turn, much cheaper.

<br>In total, there were 2 Signals and Points test systems produced and 1 Data Link test system. The systems were designed to be in use for over 20 years, with components or replacements relatively easily available. In the end, they allowed our customer to test, service and repair hundreds of thousands of products a year, allowing for a much quicker turn around, than testing each product manually.
