### Solution Description

The system is meant to be used for a large variety of tasks on a very small scale, that include:
1. Laser micro drilling;
1. Laser micro cutting;
1. Lassr micro marking;
1. Laser welding;
1. Multiphoton polimerization;
1. Laser ablation;

<br>To be able to achieve all of the above, the system uses laser optics, very precise motion stages and galvo scanners. In addition, it also can control linear and rotational axes, polarization rotators, laser power attenuators, beam expanders and stabilizers - giving it precise control of the process being carried out.

<br>All of the above devices and many others are integrated together using a single application. Some of the features supported by the software include:
1. The ability to implement the desired process as a sequence of steps;
1. Changing of device parameters before and during the process;
1. Device calibration;
1. Support for fabricating basic shapes, such as, lines, arcs, circles;
1. Support for fabricating DXF, STL and image files;
1. Manual control of each device;
1. PLC support;

<br>The solution acts as a base, that is being used to produce tens of slightly different systems every year.
