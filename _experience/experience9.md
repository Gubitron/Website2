### Solution Description

The purpose of the project was to develop a system, that would allow calibrating a large wind turbine transducer, so that it's measurement accuracy could be ensure, when it is being used to test wind turbines.
The calibration was supposed to be carried out by running user defined calibration profiles and measuring the displacement and force readings of the transducer. 
A custom solution was necessary, as, at the time, there was only one fascility in Europe that could calibrate such transducers, however the could not accommodate such a large size.

<br> To achieve the above functionality, the transducer would be installed in a large fixture with 12 pairs of hydraulic rams. Each ram capable of producing 1.5 tonnes of pressure. 
The rams would be installed in such a way, that that they could apply forces on the transducer in 6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF). Each hydraulic ram pair would be coupled with an [LVDT](https://www.te.com/usa-en/products/sensors/position-sensors/resources/lvdt-tutorial.html) and load cell sensors, for measuring displacement and pressure. Each pair would be controlled by a PID loop to maintain the desired pressure.
