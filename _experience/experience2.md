### Solution Description

The system was designed to test 8 products at a time. Each product was a missle triggering module, that needed to be tested under real world conditions, using an environmental and vibration chamber.

The product used a custom communication protocol, which was implemented using an FPGA. In addition, power supplies, switching hardware, digital and analog IO were used to test each product. Most of the testing consisted of using black box type algorithms provided by the customers, so that the inner workings of the products were not know. This made developing the system significantly harder, especially when problems would arise.

However, the system was succesfully deployed, it helped reduce the testing time for each unit significantly and eventually a second system was ordered as well.
