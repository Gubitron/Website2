### Solution Description

The goal of the project was to take an old piece of software written by the customer for monitoring the performance of a fuel burner, update it and add new features. This was needed, as the old software became very difficult to maintain, due to the old LabVIEW code not following good development practices.

For the new software, the previous functionality was left in tact as much as possible, but written in a more maintainable way. Parts of it that were not clear, were extensively discussed with the customer to provide the most suitable solution. New features were added, that greatly improved the user experience and allowed the customer to do their work more efficiently.

Since the software was written to have a simulation mode (using previous experiment data), the comissioning of it was supposed to be carried out using simulation mode. However, upon arriving on-site, the customers wanted to fire up the actual fuel burning plant. After a few of hours testing the functionality and fixing a few calculation mistakes - the customers were hapily running experiements and testing the new software themselves.

Overall, the project allowed the customers to carry out their work more quickly and to interpret their test data in a much more convienient way.
